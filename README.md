# Tower-of-Hanoi
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm along with visualization using the `turtle` module. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving disks from one peg to another with the following rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (usually included in Python standard library).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tower-of-hanoi.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd tower-of-hanoi
```

3. Run the script:

```
python tower_of_hanoi.py
```

4. Follow the instructions in the terminal to enter the number of disks and see the visualization of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

## Visualization

The Tower of Hanoi algorithm is visualized using the `turtle` module, which provides a graphical representation of the puzzle. Each disk is represented by a rectangle, and the movement of the disks is shown step by step.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance or optimize the code, add new features, or improve the visualization are welcome! If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
